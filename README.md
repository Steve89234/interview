# Post-Interview Assessment

## Introduction

The purpose of the post interview assessment is to gauge your knowledge level in different parts of software development. Each task consists of a challenge that you need to solve. Along the way you may or may not need to Google things in order to formulate your answer.

Please collect your Google search terms and paste them in the ANSWER.md document that is located in every task folder. This is not necessary but it will help us understand the direction that you take with your solution, so please consider filling it out. The answers to these tasks should be pretty trivial and are not meant to stump you in any way; they are meant to only test your proficiency.
